# machine_learning_project
The aim of this project was to employ several supervised Machine Learning techniques: 
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Linear regressors
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
to solve classification and regression tasks. 

Note: the final report contains several mistakes!
